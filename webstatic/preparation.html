      <h2>Types of Manure</h2>

      <div class="manure-item">
        <h3>Farmyard Manure</h3>
        <p>Farmyard manure (FYM) is an excellent organic fertilizer derived from decomposed animal waste, including dung, urine, and bedding material. Rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, FYM improves soil structure and fertility. Its slow-release nutrient profile supports long-term crop growth while enhancing water retention, making it ideal for dry regions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="manure-item">
        <h3>Compost Manure</h3>
        <p>Compost manure is created by decomposing organic materials like kitchen waste, crop residues, and garden debris. It is a nutrient-dense option that promotes microbial activity in the soil, resulting in improved soil texture and aeration. Compost manure helps reduce waste while providing a sustainable solution to soil enrichment, making it particularly valuable for urban farming and organic cultivation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="manure-item">
        <h3>Green Manure</h3>
        <p>Green manure involves growing specific crops, such as legumes or cover crops, that are later tilled back into the soil. These plants fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into the soil, improving its nutrient content and preventing erosion. Green manure is a practical approach for farmers looking to enhance soil health and productivity while minimizing synthetic fertilizer use.</p>

      <h2>Best Practices for Using Manure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Timing and Application:</b> Apply manure during the early growing season to maximize nutrient uptake by crops. Avoid spreading it during rainy periods to prevent runoff and water contamination.</li>
        <li><b>Proper Composting:</b> Ensure manure is adequately composted to reduce harmful pathogens and weed seeds. Composting also minimizes unpleasant odors and stabilizes nutrient content.</li>
        <li><b>Appropriate Quantities:</b> Use manure in measured quantities to meet the nutrient needs of your crops. Over-application can lead to nutrient leaching into water bodies, causing environmental harm.</li>
        <li><b>Integration with Soil:</b> Mix manure thoroughly into the soil to improve nutrient availability and reduce nitrogen loss through volatilization.</li>
        <li><b>Storage and Handling:</b> Store manure in covered facilities to prevent nutrient loss and environmental pollution. Maintain a clean storage area to minimize contamination risks.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="manure-benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Using Manure</h2>
      <p>Manure offers numerous advantages for both farmers and the environment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Improved Soil Fertility:</b> Manure is rich in essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are vital for plant growth. It replenishes depleted soils and enhances long-term productivity.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Soil Structure:</b> Organic matter in manure improves soil texture, making it easier to till and enhancing root penetration. It also boosts the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients.</li>
        <li><b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> By recycling animal and organic waste, manure reduces dependence on chemical fertilizers, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources.</li>
        <li><b>Cost-Effectiveness:</b> Manure is often a cost-effective alternative to synthetic fertilizers, especially for farmers who produce it on-site.</li>
        <li><b>Microbial Activity:</b> The organic content in manure promotes beneficial microbial activity in the soil, which aids in nutrient cycling and disease suppression.</li>
        <li><b>Reduction of Agricultural Waste:</b> Using manure helps recycle farm waste, turning potential pollutants into valuable resources.</li>
      </ul>
